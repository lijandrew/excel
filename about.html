          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            The Excel Academy of New York was founded by three parents who
            are passionate about education.
            <br><br>
            We are a modern, dynamic learning center conveniently located
            in Manhasset and Syosset, Long Island. We provide honest advice
            and realistic expectations for each of our students, giving them
            all the necessary tools to succeed. Through our work with current
            in-classroom teachers as well as feedback from students, our
            curriculum continuously adapts to meet and exceed the standards
            set by local school districts. Our teachers are passionate about
            their areas of study and are motivated to challenge students with
            higher-order thinking skills that will help them succeed in and
            beyond the classroom.
            <br><br>
            The staff at Excel Academy is
            here to serve you and help you match the programs offered with
            your children's needs and abilities.
